# my_flutter_app

This is a minimal, Codemagic-ready Flutter starter generated by ChatGPT.

What I included:
- `pubspec.yaml`
- `lib/main.dart`
- `android/` folder with app module (`app/build.gradle`, `AndroidManifest.xml`, MainActivity.kt`) and basic resources.
- A tiny launcher image (1x1 PNG) so resources are present.
- Basic gradle wrapper properties and gradlew stub.

**Notes / next steps for you:**
1. Download and unzip this project.
2. If you have custom Dart packages, merge them into `pubspec.yaml` before pushing.
3. Create a new GitHub repository (or empty one), then upload all files (use **Add file â†’ Upload files** in GitHub web UI) or push via git.
4. Connect the GitHub repo to Codemagic and run a build. Codemagic should detect a Flutter app and run `flutter build apk`.
5. If you get an error about `flutter.sdk` not found, Codemagic will have Flutter installed; no `local.properties` is required. If necessary, set the `FLUTTER_ROOT` environment variable in Codemagic settings.

If you want, after you upload this to GitHub, paste the repo URL and I'll give exact Codemagic settings (build commands / environment) to avoid the previous Gradle error.
